The registration process begins when users visit the Shoplite homepage or mobile app and click the 'Register' button. Prospective users must provide a valid email address, create a secure password meeting our complexity requirements, and enter basic personal information including first name, last name, and date of birth for age verification purposes. Email verification constitutes a critical security step in our registration workflow. Within minutes of submitting registration details, users receive a verification email containing a unique six-digit code and a verification link. This code must be entered on the verification page or the link clicked to activate the account. Accounts remain in pending status for up to 24 hours awaiting verification, after which unverified registrations are automatically purged from our systems for security and data protection reasons. Users face a fundamental account type decision during registration: buyer accounts versus seller accounts. Standard buyer accounts provide immediate access to Shoplite's comprehensive shopping features upon email verification. These free accounts enable product browsing, purchasing, wishlist creation, and review writing. Seller accounts, conversely, require additional business verification steps including tax identification number validation, business registration document submission, and in some cases, video verification for high-risk categories. The seller verification process typically requires 2-3 business days for completion, during which our dedicated verification team examines submitted documents for authenticity and compliance with marketplace standards.\"\n",

Brand filtering supports multi-select functionality, enabling users to include or exclude specific manufacturers. Seller rating filters restrict results to merchants meeting minimum feedback scores, ensuring quality shopping experiences. Product condition filters differentiate between new, refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box items with clear condition descriptions for each category. Specialized filtering options cater to specific product categories and user preferences. Electronics searches can filter by technical specifications like screen size, storage capacity, or processor type. Fashion searches support filtering by size, color, material composition, and clothing style. Home goods searches include filters for dimensions, assembly requirements, and eco-certifications.\"\n",

Products showing signs of use, damage, or missing components may receive partial refunds or be ineligible for return based on seller assessment. Category-specific return restrictions protect sellers from abuse while maintaining fair customer treatment. Personalized items including monogrammed products, custom configurations, and made-to-order merchandise typically qualify as final sales. Digital products such as software licenses, e-books, and digital downloads become ineligible once accessed or downloaded. Perishable goods including food, flowers, and certain health supplements cannot be returned for safety reasons.
