## AI Touchpoints

We are implementing two AI-powered features designed to deliver immediate business value while maintaining low integration risk:

1. **Smart Search Typeahead**: AI-enhanced search suggestions that understand natural language queries and product context, targeting conversion rate improvement through reduced search friction.

2. **Support Assistant**: Instant answers to common customer questions using our existing policy documentation and order data, targeting support ticket reduction and improved customer satisfaction.

Both touchpoints are designed with strict performance constraints (300ms p95 for search, 1200ms p95 for support) and cost controls. Detailed specifications are available in the [AI Capability Map](/docs/ai-first/ai-capability-map.md), [Touchpoint Specifications](/docs/ai-first/touchpoints.md), and [Cost Model](/docs/ai-first/cost-model.md).

These features were selected based on their direct impact on key business metrics, low technical risk, and alignment with existing data sources and infrastructure.
