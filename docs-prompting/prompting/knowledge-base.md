# Shoplite Knowledge Base

## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

Creating a Shoplite account is designed to be a seamless experience that balances security with user convenience. The registration process begins when users visit the Shoplite homepage or mobile app and click the "Register" button. Prospective users must provide a valid email address, create a secure password meeting our complexity requirements, and enter basic personal information including first name, last name, and date of birth for age verification purposes. 

Email verification constitutes a critical security step in our registration workflow. Within minutes of submitting registration details, users receive a verification email containing a unique six-digit code and a verification link. This code must be entered on the verification page or the link clicked to activate the account. Accounts remain in pending status for up to 24 hours awaiting verification, after which unverified registrations are automatically purged from our systems for security and data protection reasons.

Users face a fundamental account type decision during registration: buyer accounts versus seller accounts. Standard buyer accounts provide immediate access to Shoplite's comprehensive shopping features upon email verification. These free accounts enable product browsing, purchasing, wishlist creation, and review writing. Seller accounts, conversely, require additional business verification steps including tax identification number validation, business registration document submission, and in some cases, video verification for high-risk categories. 

The seller verification process typically requires 2-3 business days for completion, during which our dedicated verification team examines submitted documents for authenticity and compliance with marketplace standards. All registrants must explicitly agree to Shoplite's comprehensive Terms of Service and detailed Privacy Policy, which govern platform usage and data handling practices respectively. Our password security standards mandate minimum 8-character passwords containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.

Post-registration account management occurs through the dedicated account settings dashboard, where users can update personal information, manage multiple shipping addresses, configure payment methods, and set communication preferences. Enhanced security options include two-factor authentication via SMS or authenticator apps, login alert notifications for new devices, and regular password expiration prompts. Account deletion requests initiate a 14-day cooling-off period where accounts remain recoverable, after which permanent data erasure procedures commence in compliance with global data protection regulations.

## Document 4: Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite supports an extensive array of payment options designed to accommodate diverse customer preferences and regional financial ecosystems. Traditional payment instruments include major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), debit cards with credit network logos, and prepaid gift cards. Digital wallet integrations encompass PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, providing streamlined checkout experiences through tokenized payment data.

Specialized payment solutions address unique market needs. Shoplite Wallet allows balance accumulation through promotional credits, gift card redemptions, and cash deposits, with instant application during checkout. Installment payment plans through partner financial institutions enable cost spreading across multiple billing cycles for qualifying purchases. Regional payment methods include direct bank transfers in supported countries, cash on delivery in specific service areas, and local payment processors catering to particular geographic markets.

Security constitutes our foundational priority in payment processing. All transactions benefit from PCI DSS Level 1 compliance, the highest certification in payment security standards. Tokenization technology replaces sensitive payment data with unique identification symbols during transmission and storage, ensuring actual card numbers never reside on Shoplite systems. 3D Secure authentication adds an additional verification layer for card-not-present transactions, requiring password entry or biometric confirmation through issuer banking platforms.

Encryption protocols protect data throughout the payment lifecycle. Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 encryption secures data in transit between user devices and our payment processors. At rest, payment information receives AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by government agencies for classified information. Our fraud detection systems employ machine learning algorithms analyzing hundreds of transaction characteristics to identify suspicious patterns while minimizing false positives that disrupt legitimate purchases.

Payment processing timelines follow predictable schedules. Authorization requests occur immediately during checkout, temporarily reserving purchase amounts on payment methods. Settlement typically completes within 1-2 business days, transferring funds from customer accounts to Shoplite's merchant services. Failed payment attempts trigger automated retry mechanisms with three attempts across 24 hours before order cancellation, with detailed failure reasons communicated to customers for resolution.

Refund processing adheres to strict protocols aligning with original payment methods. Credit and debit card refunds appear within 5-7 business days after return processing completion, though individual bank posting times may vary. Digital wallet refunds typically process within 24-48 hours. Shoplite Wallet credits apply immediately to account balances. Payment dispute resolution procedures include detailed evidence collection, communication facilitation between parties, and arbitration processes for unresolved cases.

## Document 6: Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite's comprehensive return and refund framework balances customer satisfaction with marketplace sustainability. Our standard return policy grants customers a 30-day window from the delivery date to initiate returns for most product categories. This timeframe allows adequate product evaluation while ensuring sellers receive timely inventory returns. To qualify for return, items must maintain original condition with all manufacturer packaging, tags, accessories, and documentation intact. Products showing signs of use, damage, or missing components may receive partial refunds or be ineligible for return based on seller assessment.

Category-specific return restrictions protect sellers from abuse while maintaining fair customer treatment. Personalized items including monogrammed products, custom configurations, and made-to-order merchandise typically qualify as final sales. Digital products such as software licenses, e-books, and digital downloads become ineligible once accessed or downloaded. Perishable goods including food, flowers, and certain health supplements cannot be returned for safety reasons. Intimate apparel, swimwear, and cosmetics maintain strict hygiene standards requiring original sealed packaging for return eligibility.

The return initiation process begins through the order history section of user accounts. Customers select the specific items for return, specify reasons from standardized categories, and provide detailed descriptions of any product issues. Our automated system evaluates requests against seller policies, typically providing immediate authorization for straightforward cases while flagging complex scenarios for manual review. Approved returns generate prepaid shipping labels for most scenarios, with printing options through customer accounts or QR code display for mobile users.

Shipping responsibility varies by return circumstance. Change-of-mind returns require customers to bear return shipping costs, deducted from final refund amounts. Defective, damaged, or incorrect items shipped by sellers qualify for prepaid return labels with shipping costs covered by the responsible party. Return processing centers inspect incoming items against described conditions, with inspection results communicated to both customers and sellers. Discrepancy resolution processes address condition disagreements through photographic evidence and mediator assessment.

Refund processing follows strict timelines once returned items pass inspection. Standard refunds typically process within 5-7 business days, though banking institution variations may extend actual fund availability. Original payment method refunds apply to credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallet transactions. Purchases made with promotional credits or gift cards receive equivalent store credit refunds. Partial refunds apply to items returned with missing components, signs of use, or original packaging damage, with detailed explanations provided to customers.

These visual elements help bridge the expectation-reality gap inherent in online shopping, reducing return rates through better-informed purchasing decisions.

Review moderation maintains community standards while preserving authentic customer voices. Automated filters flag inappropriate language, personal attacks, or prohibited content before publication. Human moderators review borderline cases, balancing free expression against marketplace decorum. Prohibited content includes hate speech, discriminatory remarks, personal information disclosure, promotional material, and irrelevant political commentary. Moderation transparency includes clear guidelines and appeal processes for rejected reviews.

Community interaction features foster dialogue between customers and sellers. Helpful voting allows readers to identify the most useful reviews, with these rising to top positions in default sorting. Comment functionality enables clarification questions and follow-up discussions, though with strict civility enforcement. Seller responses provide opportunity for merchant engagement, allowing issue resolution, additional information provision, or policy clarification directly within review threads.

Incentive structures encourage participation while preventing manipulation. The review contribution system rewards customers with loyalty points for submitting detailed, helpful feedback. However, explicit review purchase, compensated testimonials, or conditional reviews tied to positive ratings constitute policy violations with serious consequences. The system detects and filters review patterns suggesting artificial manipulation, preserving the organic feedback ecosystem that benefits all marketplace participants.

## Document 18: Marketplace Quality Standards

Shoplite's marketplace quality framework establishes minimum performance thresholds maintaining customer experience consistency across diverse sellers. Seller performance metrics encompass order fulfillment rates, cancellation percentages, and customer satisfaction scores. The fulfillment rate requirement mandates 95% successful order completion within promised timeframes, measuring reliability in delivering purchased items. Cancellation rate thresholds maintain below 2% except for documented inventory discrepancies or customer-requested cancellations, ensuring order commitment integrity.

Product listing standards enforce accuracy and completeness requirements across all marketplace offerings. Title formatting prohibits excessive keyword stuffing while requiring clear product identification. Image requirements mandate minimum resolution standards, multiple angle coverage, and scale context through lifestyle shots or size comparison objects. Description completeness ensures comprehensive feature enumeration, accurate dimension reporting, and honest condition assessments for non-new items. Category assignment accuracy prevents misleading classification designed to gain inappropriate search visibility.

Prohibited items policies delineate products unsuitable for marketplace distribution due to legal restrictions, safety concerns, or brand protection requirements. Counterfeit goods prohibition extends to replicas, imitation products, and unauthorized replicas regardless of disclosure status. Regulated substances restrictions include alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and cannabis products where prohibited by jurisdiction. Weapon sales restrictions apply to firearms, ammunition, and certain accessories based on local regulations and platform policy.

Quality assurance mechanisms employ both automated monitoring and human review processes. Automated systems scan listings for policy violations using image recognition, natural language processing, and pattern detection algorithms. Manual auditing conducts random sampling of active listings with comprehensive checks against quality standards. Customer reporting channels enable community participation in quality maintenance through straightforward violation reporting interfaces. Mystery shopping programs periodically test seller compliance through controlled purchase experiences.

Enforcement procedures follow progressive action models emphasizing education before penalty. First violations typically generate warning notifications with specific policy references and correction deadlines. Repeated violations trigger temporary restrictions including search ranking demotion, new listing limitations, or promotional feature removal. Severe or persistent violations result in account suspension with detailed explanation and formal appeal procedures. Permanent termination reserves for egregious violations, repeat offenders after previous suspensions, or fraudulent activities.

Appeal processes ensure fair treatment through documented review procedures with evidence submission capabilities. Suspended sellers receive detailed violation documentation with timestamps, policy references, and supporting evidence. Response periods allow 30 days for appeal submission with additional evidence or explanatory context. Review committees comprising cross-functional representatives assess appeals based on policy interpretation, business impact, and customer protection considerations. Reinstatement conditions may include additional training, financial guarantees, or operational changes for quality improvement.
