# Component Prompts Log

This document tracks the prompts and decisions made during the development of the Storefront v1 application using AI assistance (Cursor with Claude).

## Development Approach

All components were built using AI-assisted development with human review and refinement. Each component was generated through natural language prompts, then tested and adjusted for functionality, accessibility, and performance.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation Setup

### Initial Setup
*Prompt:* "Set up a complete Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind storefront foundation with vitest for testing"

*Decisions:*
- Chose Vite for fast build times and modern dev experience
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind for utility-first styling without custom CSS frameworks
- Vitest for fast, Vite-native testing

### Storybook Configuration
*Prompt:* "Install and configure Storybook for React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind with proper styling support"

*Decisions:*
- Storybook for component documentation and isolated development
- Configured to import Tailwind styles for accurate previews

## Phase 1: Data Layer & Infrastructure

### API Layer
*Prompt:* "Create API layer with mock data fetching for products and orders. Include listProducts(), getProduct(id), getOrderStatus(id), and placeOrder(cart). Mock order statuses based on orderId pattern."

*Key Features:*
- Mock product catalog from JSON
- Simulated order status based on ID pattern
- Related products calculation by shared tags
- Error handling and null returns

### Cart State Management
*Prompt:* "Build cart state management with React Context and localStorage persistence. Include addItem, removeItem, updateQuantity, getTotal, and getItemCount functions."

*Decisions:*
- Chose React Context over Redux for simplicity
- localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Immutable state updates
- Stock validation on add/update

### Router Configuration
*Prompt:* "Set up React Router v6 with 5 routes: /, /p/:id, /cart, /checkout, /order/:id. Wrap routes with CartProvider."

*Routes Implemented:*
- / - Catalog page
- /p/:id - Product details
- /cart - Shopping cart
- /checkout - Order summary and placement
- /order/:id - Order status tracking

### Formatting Utilities
*Prompt:* "Create formatting utilities for currency (formatCurrency), dates (formatDate), ETA calculation, order ID masking (PII protection), and stock status helpers."

*Key Features:*
- Currency formatting with Intl.NumberFormat
- PII protection: mask order IDs to last 4 characters
- Stock status with color coding
- Date and ETA formatting

---

## Phase 4: Support Engine

### Keyword Matching Engine
*Prompt:* "Build support engine with keyword-based Q&A matching from ground-truth.json. Implement order ID detection (regex [A-Z0-9]{10,}), keyword scoring with stop word removal, confidence levels (high/medium/low/none), PII masking (last 4 chars), citation with [Qxx] format, out-of-scope refusal."

*Algorithm:*
1. Detect order ID if present
2. Tokenize query and questions
3. Score matches (question: 3x, answer: 1x, category: 2x)
4. Normalize by query length
5. Return best match above threshold

*Improvements Made:*
- Enhanced stop word list
- Category keyword boosting
- Phrase matching
- Better threshold (40 instead of 30)
- Helpful refusal messages with topic list

*PII Protection:* Always mask order IDs to last 4 characters

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

### Test Strategy
*Approach:* Mock child components in organism/page tests for isolation and speed

*Coverage:*
- Unit tests for all atoms, molecules, organisms
- Integration tests for pages
- Support panel tests for required scenarios
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation

### Storybook Documentation
*Stories Created:* All reusable components have stories showing:
- All variants/states
- Interactive controls
- Usage examples
- Accessibility features

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Atomic Design?
- *Scalability:* Easy to add new components by composing existing ones
- *Testability:* Each level tests independently
- *Reusability:* Build complex UIs from simple, proven parts
- *Documentation:* Clear hierarchy in Storybook
- *Team Collaboration:* Clear component boundaries

### Why No UI Library (Material-UI, Chakra, etc.)?
- *Assignment Requirement:* Custom components requested
- *Bundle Size:* Smaller footprint (< 200 KB)
- *Full Control:* Exact styling and behavior control
- *Learning:* Deeper understanding of component architecture
- *No Bloat:* Only build what's needed

### Why React Context over Redux?
- *Simplicity:* Cart state is simple (add/remove/update)
- *No Boilerplate:* Less code to maintain
- *Performance:* Adequate for small state tree
- *localStorage Integration:* Easy to implement persistence

### Why Keyword Matching over LLM?
- *Predictability:* Deterministic results
- *No API Costs:* Free to run
- *Fast Response:* Instant matching
- *Privacy:* No data sent to external services
- *Offline Capable:* Works without internet
- *Assignment Scope:* Sufficient for requirements

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Tag Filter Not Clickable
*Issue:* Badge components weren't interactive
*Solution:* Wrapped badges in button elements with onClick handlers

### Challenge 2: Product Card Navigation
*Issue:* Clicking cards didn't navigate
*Solution:* Added navigate() call in onProductClick handler, passed through ProductGrid

### Challenge 3: Support Engine Wrong Matches
*Issue:* "rewards" query matched "returns" answer
*Solution:* Enhanced keyword algorithm with category boosting, better stop words, phrase matching

### Challenge 4: Test Mocking Complexity
*Issue:* Page tests failing due to missing mocks
*Solution:* Centralized mock setup for useCart, useNavigate, and format utilities

### Challenge 5: ESC Key Not Working
*Issue:* ESC key not closing drawers/panels
*Solution:* Added useEffect with keydown listener on document in both drawer components

## Performance Optimizations

1. *Lazy Loading Images:* All product images load lazily
2. *Debounced Search:* 300ms debounce prevents excessive filtering
3. *Memoized Filters:* useMemo for filtered product calculations
4. *Code Splitting:* Router-level code splitting (if implemented)
5. *localStorage:* Persist cart without backend calls

---

## Accessibility Features

1. *Keyboard Navigation:* All interactive elements accessible via Tab
2. *Focus Management:* Focus trap in drawers/panels
3. *ARIA Labels:* All buttons, inputs, and dialogs properly labeled
